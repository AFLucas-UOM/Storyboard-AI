DELETE THIS AFTER READING THIS IS JUST MY DOCUMENTATION FOR IMAGE GEN

1. Combined all 3 python files in flask-app.py, so API token, model to generate images loading and working and upscaling is all there.
2. How do we get prompts: We take the story and send it to the LLM to give us a prompt based on the story. This is not shown to the user because it would clutter.
3. A text pops up for 2 seconds telling the user story is being generated, then a loading gif.
4. After image is done, the upscaled version is returned to the frontend, the other image (not upscaled) is needed because we need it for the upscale to work proper.
5. The image filepath is saved in local storage, this is important because this is the best way we get to save.
6. Saving the image is done after the story and is centred.

QUESTION:
Do we need redo for this? If so, should we redo the prompt generation too or just the image with the same prompt?
