# Storyboard-AI

**Storyboard-AI** is a content-generation platform that uses AI to craft engaging and creative stories. Designed with a chatbot-style interface, it guides users through a seamless process of story creation by asking for relevant details, generating narratives with accompanying visuals, and providing options to save and read the story aloud (yet to be implemented).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engages users to gather details needed for story creation.
- **AI-Generated Content**: Produces a complete story with text, images, and video components.
- **Local Save Options**: Stories, images, and videos are saved locally for offline access.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and localStorage for temporary data handling.
- **Backend**: Python Flask for processing user inputs, generating story content, and managing saved files.
- **Data Handling**: User inputs and generated media are securely managed and stored locally.

## Motivation

The main goal behind **Storyboard-AI** is to provide an intuitive platform for creative storytelling. Recognizing the growing interest in content generation tools, Storyboard-AI seeks to enhance user creativity by providing an intelligent assistant that simplifies the story-making process.

Whether for personal projects, educational purposes, or just for fun, Storyboard-AI empowers users to craft engaging narratives with minimal effort. Its ability to integrate text, visuals, and video makes it a versatile tool for creating dynamic storytelling experiences.
